# Crypto-Trading-Platform-MERN-Stack-with-Real-Time-Data-related-news-and-Social-Features
Abstract--The increasing complexity of cryptocurrency mar-
kets necessitates the development of efficient portfolio manage-
ment tools that provide real-time tracking, price updates, and
market awareness. This paper focuses on an advanced concept
of a cryptocurrency wallet service provision that provides a
summary of available coins, their prices, available quantities,
and customers’ transaction histories. Developed for the ‘frontend’
using React.js and for the ‘backend’ using Node.js, which uses
the CoinGecko API for receiving live market prices and collecting
curated news blog articles from other APIs. The data related
to the wallets are efficiently managed since the application is
built based on the MongoDB schema, and in addition to this,
the user authentication is also integrated. A responsive design of
the user interface allows for showing both a portfolio summary
and the latest news related to cryptocurrencies, thus suggesting
an ‘everything in one place’ solution for users interested in
cryptocurrencies. This system shows how real-time data inte-
gration could be implemented, how the system is friendly to
users, and how the system manages the content. This system
could be expanded in the future with predictive analytics and an
AI recommendation system for the portfolio management and
contents.
